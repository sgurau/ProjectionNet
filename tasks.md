1. Push all code and data into github.
2. Apply MDS with Euclidean distance and compare all dimensionality reduction results in thesis
3. Fix SVM code using precomputed kernel
4. Apply SVM with RBF kernel on MDS + SPD geodesic distance matrix results (2D) with cross validation 

   
# 8 June 2023
1. Download and process data for analysis.
2. Read Lama2021 paper and replicate their methods on the data.
3. Sort out HPC connection if possible. 

# 1 June 2023
1. batch processing script for all the collected data for replicability purpose. 

# 18 May 2023
TWo directions: 
1. Data analysis on fMRI -> brain network, e.g. new classification models, the effects of parameters in data acquisition to down-stream analysis, etc. 
2. neuroscience questions we can answer using ADNI or other data sets (need Gen's input)

Things to do 
1. Apply AAL atlas 
2. Investigate slice time correction (whether ADNI data need it or not) 
3. Visualise brain networks (in matlab, not urgent) 

# 19 April 2023

1. complete the preprossessing of fMRI images to obtain brains and active regions 
2. implement any brain atlas to extract nodes and superimpose to the brain activities data to form brain networks
