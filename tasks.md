TWo directions: 
1. Data analysis on fMRI -> brain network, e.g. new classification models, the effects of parameters in data acquisition to down-stream analysis, etc. 
2. neuroscience questions we can answer using ADNI or other data sets (need Gen's input)

Things to do 
1. Apply AAL atlas 
2. Investigate slice time correction (whether ADNI data need it or not) 
3. Visualise brain networks (in matlab, not urgent)

1. complete the preprossessing of fMRI images to obtain brains and active regions 
2. implement any brain atlas to extract nodes and superimpose to the brain activities data to form brain networks
