Preprocssing sample data:

1.Brain Extraction from anatomical data (bet): To remove non-brain tissue- skull, scalp, and soft tissues to isolate the brain. 

2 Motion correction (mcflirt) and spatial smoothing (fslmaths) of functional data: 
  
  - Motion correction to realign each image in fmri time series to a common reference image (usually the first image). Head movements can introduce noise. 
  - Smoothing to reduce noise and improve signal to noise ratio.

3.Register functional data to anatomical data (obtained in step 1) and then to standard space (MNI152 2mm) (flirt - linear transformation).

4.Perform brain parcellation using Harvard-oxford Atlas.
  
  - Combine the cortical and sub-cortical atlas (fslmaths).
  - Register the combined atlas to the functional data in MNI space (flirt â€“ linear transformation).

5.Extract time series for each region (fslmeants).

6.Run functional_connectivity.py to compute functional connectivity between brain regions with Pearson Correlation.
